# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to analysis ride share data. Combining data about cities and fare costs with driver counts.

## Results:
This chart illustrates the different revenue sectors for the company. As expected we see a higher total revenue from urban areas and lowest from rural areas. The following chart is filtered down to a subset of time within the dataset to give a good picture of the differences.

We can dive a little deeper into this dataset. The below chart shows there are considerably more riders and drivers in the urban areas than suburban and rural areas. When looking from urban to rural this results in a spread of $24 to $34 dollars per ride and an average driver fare from $16 to $55.

## Summary:

There are a few considerations that can be extracted from these results. It could be assumed that in rural areas while you have lower populations the riders start and stop destinations could potentially have a pattern such as to and from an airport, school, or main street. Having a straight rate for standard fares could attract more people to use the service. Further analysis could be done to look at driver pick up and drop of locations to see how the distance of travel affects each of these results as well as an analysis that investigates the relationship of rides verses the total population of each city.
